WeaStyle is initially a conceptualised website to assist with styling matters related to the weather. Initially, the project included several APIs, including Google Maps for Geolocation-friendly advice and Pinterest API to help users understand the available styles. 

The current state of Weastyle is highly buggy and incomplete due to inexperience with HTML, CSS and Javascript; the project ended up being bigger than anticipated. Hence, the state it is in now. In its current state, there are new tabs with smaller projects inside them, a to-do list to assist users with what they need to remember for their fashion needs, a posts/blog area for users to read up on new fashion updates relating to different seasons; a profile section for users to edit their accounts and a weather widget that remains incomplete that is meant to sit on the home page however disrupts the flow of the registration and login pop up. 

The debugging process was done on Google Chrome and hence should mainly run well on the platform; however, when using VSCode users may need to be aware of debugging containers, having Javascript, HTML, and CSS already set up on their device's local VSCode to look at the code correctly.

I had major issues with running the website on a live server. The website's current state is completely based on what I could see at the time.

I also had issues with the original set-up of the homepage. This was especially hard as I had no idea how to use HTML and CSS, so the heading ended up in the middle instead of the header.

This was the original mockup of the Login page before I realised it reminded me too much of a game log-in on top of how it was somewhat working in terms of the layout, despite the code not working how I wanted it to have ended up in a state where I was content.

I could not solve the issue quickly; however, I did enjoy this login page better than the original. It provided a more airy feel making it feel more 'weather' and skylike.

I had started adding in the navigation bar and found out how to fix the heading in the middle; however, I was having issues with the navigation bar not being optimised to the screen. However, I did manage to resolve this issue at a later date.

I had accidentally followed a different tutorial and installed the icon package and thought that because it was not downloading correctly, I would be unable to use the icons. I later learned I needed to copy and paste the 'font' text from the provided website.

I did not realise while making the weather widget; users would have to share their location through their browser; I understood that many users would be reluctant to do so; hence, I decided to opt out of it and try making a different type of weather input.

These were from the first weather widget (the code can be found in inactive code inside index.html. This weather widget had become buggy and was not displaying the correct screen while also disrupting the log-in popup.

I had further issues with all the line code I couldn't figure out where one of the brackets went as I got confused as there were too many to look at and were visually just extremely confusing to analyse and understand. It was not functioning the way that it should hence a more frustrated work around.

My blog page was not functioning as I hoped it would hence due to some errors I realised I had to move it to a different css though it will take more HTML requests, I had to find a way to fix the error however overall I was not able to completely finish it.

When learning how to do the weather widget I found it confusing adding APIs but managed to do it. I further was struggling as some of the line code was not in line with each section hence why the code kept breaking.

Furthermore, since I originally had all the cs and js files together, I was getting confused what I renamed each folder and file. With the images I did not realise you had to be able to tag and link them through their folders and subfolders hence having go through all the files. I also realised there were errors due to the fact I also misspelt some words hence it was reading wrong.
